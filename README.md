# Project 5: Databricks

This project explores the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates, case rates, and mortality across different continents during the pandemic. Using data from Our World in Data, the World Bank, and Wikipedia, I will utilize Databricks to prepare, analyze, and visualize data to determine whether higher vaccination rates are associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases and mortality rates globally.
